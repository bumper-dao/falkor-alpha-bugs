# Bumper falkor aplha testing bugs. 

This repository will be used to highlight the issues we are finding in our Alpha testing phase. 
Our alpha testers will be able to use this repo to see if the issues reported are relevant bugs or not and also it would allow for other testers to ensure that they are not report duplicate bugs. 

To see the bugs, you can head over to the issues section. Current, issue creation is restricted to Bumper-dao Admins. 

Feel free to explore the bugs and maybe suggest some unique fixes that our team can use to make the Bumper Dapp better.
